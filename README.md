# javaproject
Athens University of Economics and Business first year java project 
We had to create a Banking System using java. In this project we used Hashmaps so us to imrpove the speed of our programm and the storage of our data, 
Array lists to store the objects created by each class for their better use in for loops.
Also, our program had a control to assure that the user selected the right menu option and a part where it created a txt file with some of the data given.
I did this project with the help of a girl and we scored 10 out of 10 doing exactly what the task wanted!
